Fabber now uses CMake with a view to building on Win32

A couple of simple shell scripts are provided for Unix-style environments:

rebuild.sh <type>

Rebuild from scratch. <type> is the build type - Debug or Release. The
default is Debug.

install.sh <type>

Install previously build files. Build type is as above. The installation
prefix is taken from the PREFIX environment variable, which defauls to
$HOME. To install globally you might do:

PREFIX=/usr/local install.sh Release

The scripts are very simple and you may wish to run cmake directly instead.
