Getting Fabber
==============

Fabber is distributed as part of  `FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki>`_,
and this is the easiest way to get Fabber if you want to use existing
models for fMRI data . This documentation describes the 
version of Fabber included with FSL v6.0.1 and above.

If you want to build your own models, or if you need a more up to date
version of Fabber than the one included with FSL, you can build Fabber from
the source code available in the `Github repository <https://github.com/ibme-qubic/fabber.git>`_.
Pre-built binaries may be available for some platforms.

To build the source code, see `Building Fabber`_.
