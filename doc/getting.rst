Getting Fabber
==============

Fabber is distributed as part of  `FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki>`_,
and this is the easiest way to get Fabber if you want to use existingi 
models for fMRI data . This documentation describes the 
version of Fabber included with FSL v6.0.1 and above.

Fabber source code is stored in the IBME Git repository. The basic
commands to get the latest code are:

::

   git clone https://ibme-gitcvs.eng.ox.ac.uk/fabber/fabber_core.git

You may need to enter your GITLAB username and password at this point.

This command will create a directory fabber_core containing the source
code. To build the code, see `Building Fabber`_.
