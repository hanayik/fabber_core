This is a general list of coding style standards to use when adding or modifying
code in Fabber. Adhering to these standards will improve code readability
because you can make assumptions about the code without having to check
(e.g. the symbol mvn_dist is a local variable, not a class, function or 
a member variable). In addition, keeping style consistent ensures that
version control diffs show only meaningful changes and not irrelevant 
changes to spacing, etc.

Updating Fabber to these guidelines is an ongoing task as files are edited
and refactored. Currently many files are not updated. dataset.cc/dataset.h are 
believed to be reasonably consistent with these guidelines.

Guidelines will be added as required, but the intention is to keep this as
brief as possible and not turn into a 'How you should write C++' guide.

1. Bracing/indent style

BSD/Allman style is used, e.g.

void FabberRunData::Parse(int argc, char** argv)
{
	for (int a = 1; a < argc; a++)
	{
		if (string(argv[a], 0, 2) == "--")
		{
			string key = argv[a] + 2; // skip the "--"
			AddKeyEqualsValue(key);
		}
		else
		{
			LOG << "Option doesn't begin with --: " + string(argv[a]);
			throw Invalid_option("An option doesn't begin with --\n");
		}
	}
}

This tends to separate out the code and make it less dense. A major issue
with Fabber code at present is that too much is crammed into a single function!
Use of this style will emphasise this and encourage refactoring (hopefully).

Eclipse contains this style as a built in option. Once selected, SHIFT-CTRL-F will
reformat your current file in this style.

2. Tabs/spaces

Tabs are used for all indentation, and should normally be viewed as 4 spaces. Spaces can be used
for other whitespace.

3. Naming conventions

Classes are in CamelCase, e.g.

FabberRunData
FwdModel

Functions are also in CamelCase, e.g.

FwdMode.Evaluate

Variables are in lower case with underscores, e.g.

image_priors

Member variables should be prefixed with m_, e.g.

m_param_names[3]

4. Header files

Header files should be self-contained. I should always be able to do:

#include "fwdmodel.h"

Without having to worry about including any other headers. This means 
that fwdmodel.h should contain all #includes that it needs.

Header files should include guards against multiple inclusion, e.g.

#ifndef FABBER_FWDMODEL_H
#define FABBER_FWDMODEL_H
...
...
#endif

Header files should not generally contain function implementations. 
As a general rule, only empty functions or one-line functions (e.g.
getters/setters) should be implemented in a header file.

Do not put "using namespace" in a header file, as it will affect
any code which includes that header.

5. Documentation and comments

All public members should have Doxygen documentation

// Comments should be used to explain code in cc files

Do not 'comment out' code. Either 
 - Remove it (Version control means it isn't really lost)
 - Use #ifdef 0 ... #endif to temporarily remove
